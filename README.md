# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone that is AJAX-based. It uses JQuery, HTML5 and CSS and was used to help bootcamp students comfortable with working with front-end applications. We also built upon it to practice our HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and our Node, Express back-end skills.

It's functional, aesthetically pleasing, and fun to use.
